                    <p>We tackle the task of long-form music generation—particularly the challenging lyrics-to-song
problem—by introducing YuE (乐), a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2
architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of
music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal
melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through: (1) track-decoupled nexttoken prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning
for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to
converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for
music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into
an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of
the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables
additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation,
we show that YuE’s learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks,
where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.</p>

    Step back cause I'll ignite
    Won't quit without a fight
    No escape, gear up, it's a fierce fight
    Brace up, raise your hands up and light
    Fear the might. Step back cause I'll ignite

    I'm feeling wild, got a bit of rebel style.
    Locked inside my mind, hot flame.

[verse]
In the quiet of the evening, shadows start to fall
Whispers of the night wind echo through the hall
Lost within the silence, I hear your gentle voice
Guiding me back homeward, making my heart rejoice

[chorus]
Don't let this moment fade, hold me close tonight
With you here beside me, everything's alright
Can't imagine life alone, don't want to let you go
Stay with me forever, let our love just flow

[verse]
Moonlight paints a picture upon your lovely face
Every glance between us fills the empty space
Time stands still around us when you're in my arms
Nothing else can matter, safe from any harm

[chorus]
Don't let this moment fade, hold me close tonight
With you here beside me, everything's alright
Can't imagine life alone, don't want to let you go
Stay with me forever, let our love just flow

[bridge]
Every touch ignites a fire, burning deep within
Every smile you give to me makes my head spin
Promise me you'll stay awhile, don't ever say goodbye
Together we'll chase every star across the sky

[chorus]
Don't let this moment fade, hold me close tonight
With you here beside me, everything's alright
Can't imagine life alone, don't want to let you go
Stay with me forever, let our love just flow

[verse]
Woke up in the morning, sun is shining bright
Chasing all my dreams, gotta get my mind right
City lights are fading, but my vision's clear
Got my team beside me, no room for fear
Walking through the streets, beats inside my head
Every step I take, closer to the bread
People passing by, they don't understand
Building up my future with my own two hands

[chorus]
This is my life, and I'm aiming for the top
Never gonna quit, no, I'm never gonna stop
Through the highs and lows, I'mma keep it real
Living out my dreams with this mic and a deal

[verse]
Late nights grinding, writing down these rhymes
Clock is ticking fast, can't afford to waste time
Haters gonna hate, but I brush it off
Turn the negativity into something strong
Mama working hard, wanna make her proud
Echoes of her prayers cutting through the crowd
Friends turned strangers, but it's all good
Focused on my path like I always knew I would

[chorus]
This is my journey, and I'm running this race
Heart full of fire, you can see it in my face
Obstacles ahead, but I got no fear
Victory is close, yeah, it's almost here

[bridge]
They said I couldn't do it, said I'd never rise
But now I'm soaring high, reaching for the skies
Lessons that I learned made me who I am
Standing tall now, I don't give a damn

[verse]
Echoes in the alley, music's getting loud
Feeling the adrenaline pumping through the crowd
Spotlights on me, it's my time to shine
Living in the moment, everything's aligned
Looking back now at the roads I've crossed
Every single battle, every line I've tossed
Made me stronger, wiser, ready for what's next
Writing my own story, turning pages of the text

[chorus]
This is my song, and I'm singing it proud
Voices united, hear us shout out loud
From the underground straight into the stars
Carving out my name, leaving all these scars

[outro]
Yeah, this is for the dreamers, the ones who never quit
Keep your head up high, and don't you ever submit
Life is what you make it, so make it something great
Step into your purpose, go and seize your fate

[verse]
Staring at the sunset, colors paint the sky
Thoughts of you keep swirling, can't deny
I know I let you down, I made mistakes
But I'm here to mend the heart I didn't break

[chorus]
Every road you take, I'll be one step behind
Every dream you chase, I'm reaching for the light
You can't fight this feeling now
I won't back down
I'm the whisper in the wind, the shadow by your side
The warmth you feel within when you can't hide
You know you can't deny it now
I won't back down

[verse]
They might say I'm foolish, chasing after you
But they don't feel this love the way we do
My heart beats only for you, can't you see?
I won't let you slip away from me

[chorus]
Every road you take, I'll be one step behind
Every dream you chase, I'm reaching for the light
You can't fight this feeling now
I won't back down
I'm the whisper in the wind, the shadow by your side
The warmth you feel within when you can't hide
You know you can't deny it now
I won't back down

[bridge]
No, I won't back down, won't turn around
Until you're back where you belong
I'll cross the oceans wide, stand by your side
Together we are strong

[outro]
Every road you take, I'll be one step behind
Every dream you chase, love's the tie that binds
You can't fight this feeling now
I won't back down

[verse]
She arrives here each day
This small lady with hair of grey
And she merely grins and stumbles
On her way


[verse]
In these hospital hallways
She strolls along these silent ways
To a chair
Where an old woman used to stay
And an old woman used to pray
I'm in the autumn of my days


[verse]
I've known the gladness
I've known the stress
I've just gone through the doctor's mess
Please don't sigh, my dear love mine



[verse]
He arrived here not long past
And the physicians were in doubt
If the moment for him to pass
Was nigh


[verse]
But when the time arrived
And he closed his eyes to rest
She pleaded to the Lord above
His spirit to bless
And as she turned away to grieve
It felt like she could sense
I'm in the dawn of a new life


[verse]
I've known the gladness
I've known the stress
I've just faced the doctor's test
Please don't sigh, my dear love best


[verse]
She'll stay there for quite a while
And recall their love with a smile
And set it there, the freshest flowers in style


[verse]
She stands near that silent door
Her tired heart is sore and worn
And the tales that they once told
Still ring in her ears so cold


[chorus]
I'm in the autumn of my life
I've known the joy
I've known the strife
I've just come out of the sickroom light
Please don't sigh, my dear delight
'Cause you and I, we've shared some light



[chorus]
And our love has reached far and wide
And in the glow of stars at night
You and I will always unite

[verse]
Hey 你此刻是否还好呀
狂风  在窗外肆意地刮
想起  一同漫步的那一下
你讲会伴我到天涯
我们牢牢牵手不撒  无需再畏惧害怕


[verse]
Oh Dear 笑容是否还灿烂
天真 是否已经消散
季节更替了 需添衣保暖
注意别再受风寒
毕竟如今我已不在 你身旁作伴


[chorus]
Someday 他给予的誓言已消散
若你回忆那昨天
请你能够念我 My Love


[inst]
你我心并未走散  

[verse]
Oh Dear 笑容是否还灿烂
天真 是否已经消散
气温变低了 要注意保暖
别让自己受风寒
毕竟如今我已不在 陪在你的那一端


[chorus]
Someday 那约定的美好未抵达
倘若你追忆往昔
请你试着念我 My Love
我与你并非天涯

[verse]
In the quiet of the evening, shadows start to fall
Whispers of the night wind echo through the hall
Lost within the silence, I hear your gentle voice
Guiding me back homeward, making my heart rejoice

[chorus]
Don't let this moment fade, hold me close tonight
With you here beside me, everything's alright
Can't imagine life alone, don't want to let you go
Stay with me forever, let our love just flow

[verse]
Moonlight paints a picture upon your lovely face
Every glance between us fills the empty space
Time stands still around us when you're in my arms
Nothing else can matter, safe from any harm

[chorus]
Don't let this moment fade, hold me close tonight
With you here beside me, everything's alright
Can't imagine life alone, don't want to let you go
Stay with me forever, let our love just flow

[bridge]
Every touch ignites a fire, burning deep within
Every smile you give to me makes my head spin
Promise me you'll stay awhile, don't ever say goodbye
Together we'll chase every star across the sky

[chorus]
Don't let this moment fade, hold me close tonight
With you here beside me, everything's alright
Can't imagine life alone, don't want to let you go
Stay with me forever, let our love just flow

So come on and take my hand
Please, take my hand
Now, don't start fretting, trying to understand

So come on and take the flight
Please, take the flight

Situations like this we could prevent

Da-dum, da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-dum, da-dum
Walking down this lonesome road
Thinking 'bout the love untold
Why haven't I told you
I've whispered to the midnight stars

[chorus]
Friends keep asking if I'm fine
I just smile and say you're mine
Maybe you feel the same way too
Oh darling, if you do
Why haven't you told me
Da-dum, da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[verse]
I've sung it to the morning sun
That with you, my life's begun
Why haven't I told you
My heart's an open book today
Waiting for the words to say
Why haven't I told you

[chorus]
Friends keep asking what's the news
I just grin and think of you
Time to take a chance
Let my feelings show
Maybe you feel the same way too
Oh darling, if you do
Why haven't you told me

[bridge]
Da-dum, da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-dum, da-dum
No more holding back these words
Let them fly just like the birds

Hoping that I got it right
Maybe you feel the same way too
Oh darling, if you do
Let's not waste another day
Why haven't we told us

[verse]
Standing on the corner, shadows in the night
The city's heartbeat echoes under lights
Hands deep in pockets, wandering alone
Footsteps tracing paths to the unknown
Suddenly he pauses, looks up to the sky

[chorus]
Lost within the chaos, seeking out a sign
In a world of color, drawing blurred lines
Moving forward, looking back, unsure of the way
Trying to find a place where he can stay

[verse]
He crosses empty streets, under neon glow
Faces in the crowd, stories left untold
Raises up his arms, reaching for the truth
Grasping at the fragments of his youth

[chorus]
Lost within the chaos, seeking out a sign
In a world of color, drawing blurred lines
Moving forward, looking back, unsure of the way
Trying to find a place where he can stay

[bridge]
Doesn't want to leave, doesn't want to fight
Caught between the darkness and the light
No need for reason, nothing to prove
Just a soul in transit, with nothing to lose

[outro]
Doesn't want to leave, doesn't want to fight
Chasing after shadows in the night
He doesn't need the truth, doesn't need a name
Just looking for a spark to fan the flame

[verse]
Three more days pass and no more heartache
These are the thoughts I make
I've been searching through the dark
Though my spirit starts to break
That I could be brave
The South would be so glad of me


[verse]
How would you act


[verse]
When the moon hides behind the cloud
And you're only two steps from breakdown?


[chorus]
Lemonade, Madeira, heart in disguise
So we take our shiny stars
And use them as scars
Now there's nothing left for me to fear
My own tears and silent cheer
But I'll stand here

The South would be so glad of me



[inst]



[verse]
So I'll meet you the next day
Shall we say it's done?
Trying to make flames ignite
Seeing as they've run
You don't know how to cherish that
But I know how to cherish that
I believe we'll be okay
The North would be so glad for you


[chorus]
What would you say

When moons fade in the night
And you're just one breath from breaking?

疙疙瘩瘩，松松垮垮，
歪歪扭扭，坑坑洼洼。
大脑，今天再次启动咯！
行嘞~！
我是疙疙瘩瘩的大脑，
时而迷糊时而明晰。
我是疙疙瘩瘩的大脑，
哟呵！搞清楚了！
我是松松垮垮的大脑，
有时愉快有时烦闷。
我是松松垮垮的大脑，
哎~实在太烦啦！

思一思后做判定。

皱皱巴巴，软软绵绵，
弯弯曲曲，凹凸不平。
大脑，今天也多谢你啦！

[chorus]
都唤他江湖酷佬 ei 江湖酷佬
他渴望荣华财宝 ei 荣华财宝
世界能够那般广 世界亦那般渺
哎哟 你也听闻他 ayo 如此凑巧


[verse]
大伙都在讲你很牛啦 你本事确实大啦
我已然被你折服啦 O~
你跟那国外嘻哈咖挺像啦
光彩那是相当亮啦 胜过头顶的月亮啦
他的电话声响起ring ring
几句话里几句bling bling
零用钱换了ring ring
说再会 他讲pingping wu

他特豪爽 从不拖拉 能露脸的事儿绝不犯傻
戴着帽子 让你心神不宁 他一现身就好似寒风刮来
他知晓努力就有回报 却不明晓宽以待人 也不在意
渴望迅速拼搏一番 把你当工具使唤 走着山路 un


[verse]
他方言说得溜
遇人就喊好兄弟
撸起胳膊 欲做那把头
可他却偏爱那点小便宜
使他名声扫地
把他当挚友 可他把哥们当小弟
对他讲真心话他不珍惜 情谊渐渐地被他遗弃


[verse]
各类事情都想干
这兄弟特别悍
心中偶像周润发
他要做个街头霸
敢冲敢闯 你的善意他当是懦弱 引发争执与怒火
一回回把他当友可这般下去会走散
说对了你别夸俺 For free （这一条不收费哦）


[chorus]

都叫他江湖酷佬 ei 江湖酷佬

世界能够那么广 世界没有那么窄
哎哟 你也听闻他 ayo 如此凑巧


[verse]
哥们口气放得狂 自称街头王中王
金表得有十来块 神采飞扬够闪亮
场面一定得撑住 潇洒自如压个场
出门开辆法拉利 誓要成为强中强


[verse]
他事先对你一顿呛 习惯事后再给你点希望
不知不觉信任快耗光 临时补救是他的惯样
他仍然能四处闯荡
可情谊却难以再往
忧愁显在他的面庞
深夜的巷子里灯光下像只孤独的野狼


[verse]

渐渐大伙不捧场 他不明所以不转向
他常言未来路还长 但当下他的路摇晃

他的心境渐失常 独自之时难安详
他怨友朋 太吝啬太薄凉 却未看清己模样

并无深仇大恨藏 可为何又遇这状况
一笑能否解怨怅 ask me MR 江湖郎
望着家中财与宝 他不知如何是好
时而欢乐时而忧 做人实在太难熬 哎 这江湖郎

[verse]
我也并非无畏惧 我也并非不知险
然而在深情相拥之际 哪怕艰难
崇山峻岭 为你也愿作坦途
爱你无需讲道理


[verse]
但愿用真心实意去陪伴你
一想到心中的你 从未有过的勇气
猛然充满渐乏的身体

旁人全都阻拦 连道理也难容
仍全心奔赴 痛也不会哼
似追逐那片虹 谁人怎样猛冲
都难比我为你这般疯

前路荆棘再多 无人可阻我步
看着是千难万险都敢赴
我不够成熟 仅存有这份顽固



[verse]
我也渴望被关怀
但甘心成为卫士来守护你
荣耀你不赐予我 依旧执意走下去
洒脱笑着为你抗风雨


[chorus]
他人始终质疑 连常理也不顾
仍全心付出 苦都不觉苦
仍执着一份情 谁人道我顽固
亦不如我为你那般笃



[chorus]
前方阻碍重重 无人可让我停
看着那艰难险阻都前行
我并非无情 仅存这腔赤诚



[chorus]
摔下去再站起 就像是小强兵
明明已受挫折 仍努力去前行


[chorus]
他人从不认可 连道理也不通
仍全心付出爱都不觉浓
仍执着一段情 谁人怎样冲动
亦不如我为你那般疯



[chorus]
沿途风雨再猛 无人可阻我行
望着是千难万险都敢迎
哪怕无陪伴 依旧存这份坚定
期待情的人 全部情得很坚定

[verse]
In the quiet of the evening, shadows start to fall
Whispers of the night wind echo through the hall
Lost within the silence, I hear your gentle voice
Guiding me back homeward, making my heart rejoice

[chorus]
Don't let this moment fade, hold me close tonight
With you here beside me, everything's alright
Can't imagine life alone, don't want to let you go
Stay with me forever, let our love just flow

[verse]
Moonlight paints a picture upon your lovely face
Every glance between us fills the empty space
Time stands still around us when you're in my arms
Nothing else can matter, safe from any harm

[chorus]
Don't let this moment fade, hold me close tonight
With you here beside me, everything's alright
Can't imagine life alone, don't want to let you go
Stay with me forever, let our love just flow

[bridge]
Every touch ignites a fire, burning deep within
Every smile you give to me makes my head spin
Promise me you'll stay awhile, don't ever say goodbye
Together we'll chase every star across the sky

[chorus]
Don't let this moment fade, hold me close tonight
With you here beside me, everything's alright
Can't imagine life alone, don't want to let you go
Stay with me forever, let our love just flow

I, the Moon of night
The child of the cosmic sight
My shine dimmed and lost within the sky
That I may find harmony in this land


[verse]
I, child of rebellion
From pure emptiness defied
Towards the loftiest soul, to boundless liberty
To uncover the fiery essence of my plea

[verse]
I, spark of creation
The truth of nature I embrace
I carry the flame of Prometheus
So I can light the dark and guide the stars

I, celestial rebel
Infusing frenzy in my soul
With hope embraced, with tears unleased
Is the wisdom of gods in man whole?

The thrill of the eve
Sustained am I by this cosmic wave
Where high above blends with deep below

Wandering I march towards the broken throne

[verse]
Moments of love
Moments of pain
Floating by within my brain
Now, then, soon, a single chain
Nights of fun
Nights of woe
Come and leave as I still know
A week, a month, a thousand days, they go
Oh, someday I will depart to find a new way


[chorus]
No, and this world won't pause to spin along with me
'Cause time
Marks time
Marks on without us free
Ever goes


[verse]
Sure time
Speeds time
Speeds along and never gone
Flows continuously



[verse]
Times of hope
Times of strife
Endless journey is our life
Can't give up now, not till we're through
We yearn for more serenity, and perhaps a new life
This one is brief, no matter what you do



[chorus]
Oh, don't ever lose the faith to live a great life
No, don't squander your precious time to make it strife



[chorus]
Time
Flows time
Flows on leaving us behind
Never pauses
Yes time
Moves time

Moves along and never gone
Flows continuously

Please please let me find
The path that's truly mine
Make a move and we shine so fine


[chorus]
No more idle days
No more futile ways
Life's too brief to sigh
Long enough to fly



[chorus]
Time
Flees time
Flees away without a sound
Never slows

Yes time
Moves time
Moves along and never gone
Flows continuously

In the heart of knowledge, where dreams take flight,
A vision unfolds, bathed in radiant light.
The AMC stands proud, a beacon so bright,
Where art meets machine, a future in sight.

With creativity sparked, and minds set ablaze,
Innovation will flourish in myriad ways.
From pixels to patterns, in harmony blend,
A journey begins, where boundaries extend.

A tapestry rich, in which all can believe.
With each brushstroke and code, a story will grow,
In this realm of wonder, new ideas will flow.

Let's celebrate this moment, this path we embrace,
In the dance of the digital, we'll find our place.
At HKUST, where the future ignites,
The Arts and Machine, a symphony of sights.

So here's to the dreamers, the makers, the bold, 
In this vibrant new division, let visions unfold.
Together we’ll craft, innovate, and inspire.
At AMC, we’ll reach ever higher!

[verse]
Was 25 striving to find my path to Neptune
A short escape didn't seem so wrong
Was filled with doubts tied up hard like concrete
Running on low, so nearly gone
Thought I wasn't wise
And I wasn't so strong


[verse]
Sitting in the darkened room
We were tied with endless gloom
And I thought the blame was mine
Couldn't bear it anymore


[chorus]
With the strength from within
(No more hiding in the shade)
I lifted my spirit high
(I made a choice to fly)
I took one step after another and I


[chorus]
Faced the mirror and chose to remain
Wasn't gonna let love lead me astray
This way


[verse]
I thank my brother for keeping my spirit from drowning
When the reality was like chewing on lead
Now every dawn
There is no more sadness, oh yeah
I can truly find myself anew
I know I am worthy
Able to be cared
It wasn't for me to quit
Now I must soar beyond
Let the cosmos prove it wrong
Yeah the truth will make me strong


[chorus]
By the strength of soul
(There was no turning back)
I raised myself anew
(I knew I couldn't slack)
I took one step after another and I


[chorus]
Stared at the mirror and chose to remain
Wasn't gonna let heartache drive me insane
That way no
There ain't no
Not in the name of pain
In the name of pain
(In the name of pain)
That way
There ain't no
I'm not giving in


[chorus]

By the strength of will
I made myself stand tall
I take one step after another and I
Looked to the future
(Looked to the future)
Looked to the future
(Looked to the future)


[chorus]
With the strength from within
(No other path to win)
I lifted myself once more
(I realized I must endure)
I take one step after another and I

Stared at the mirror and chose to remain
Wasn't gonna let heartbreak drive me insane

[verse]
How does a waif, an outcast, child of a strumpet and a
Welshman, placed in the midst of an overlooked
Nook in the Atlantic by Destiny, destitute, in disarray
Rise up to be a legend and a sage
Well the news spread wide, they claimed, this lad is remarkable, man
Raised a fund just to dispatch him to the mainland
Gain your knowledge, don't neglect where you originated, and


The world will hear your fame, what's your name, lad
Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
We are standing by for you (standing by for you)
You could never give in
You never learned to slow your spin


[chorus]
Oh, Benjamin Franklin (Benjamin Franklin)
America praises you
Will they know what you achieved?
Will they know you changed the scheme?
The world will always remember, Benjamin



[verse]
You'll come back
In no time
You'll recall that you're mine
You'll come back
Fate will shine
You'll recall that I'm fine



[verse]
Mountains stand, kingdoms crash
We've journeyed together, through every clash
And when times get tough,
I'll dispatch a force that's truly enough to show you my love's vast

Hey yo, I'm as strong as my land
I'm brave, eager, and grand
And I won't let my chance go past

I'ma gain entry to King's College fair
I perhaps shouldn't boast, but eh, I shock and astound
The hitch is I've got much wit, but lack grace
I must shout just to be noticed
With each word I impart wisdom
I know the scene on the street is thrilling
But Lord, amid all the bleeding and brawling
I've been studying and penning
We ought to address our fiscal condition
Are we a land of states, what's the state of our land
I'm beyond patient waiting! I'm fervently shattering every anticipation
Every deed is an act of innovation
I'm smiling in the face of losses and grief
For the first time, I'm looking beyond today


[chorus]
And I won't let my chance pass by
I won't let my chance pass by
Hey, yo, I'm just like my land
I'm brave, strong, and ready to stand
And I won't let my chance pass by
I won't let my chance pass by
I won't let my chance pass by
Time to make a try
Make a try
And I won't let my chance fly


[bridge]
Not giving up my quest
You will thrive with our newfound land
We'll strive and toil for you
We'll make it fine for you
If we build a sturdy base
We'll hand it down to you
We'll offer the world to you and you'll astound us all through
Someday, someday
Yeah you'll astound us all through


[chorus]
I long to be in
The place where dreams take flight
The place where dreams take flight
The place where dreams take flight
I long to be in
The place where hopes ignite
The place where hopes ignite
The place where hopes ignite
No one truly grasps how the path is laid
The skill of the chase
How the stars are made
We merely suppose that it's made
But no one else can take this place



[bridge]
The place where it starts  

[chorus]
I kept every gift you gave to me
From the instant I received them
I felt you were mine
You claimed you were mine
I believed you were mine


[outro]
Oh, I long to hold you once more
It's merely a question of
Time
Will they recount your tale
Time
Who thrives, who fades, who narrates your story
Time
Will they speak of your glory
Time


[outro]
Who weeps, who hopes, who shares your story
Who dreams, who schemes, who cares your story

[verse]
斑马斑马 别再沉睡了
让我看见你伤痕累累的尾巴
我不愿触碰你那道疤痕
只想轻拂你飘逸的发丝

[verse]
斑马斑马 你已归于故乡
而我却在寒冷中虚度年华
你的城市对我关闭了所有的门扉
终究我只能再次踏上孤独的旅途

[chorus]
斑马斑马 你来自南方的绯红
这是否也是一段动人心弦的故事

若你身旁的戏子无法留下
谁会陪伴我直到天明

[chorus]
斑马斑马 你还记得我吗
我是那个只会歌唱的傻瓜

[chorus]
斑马斑马 安眠吧安眠吧
我将背起吉他离开北方

[verse]
斑马斑马 你还记得我吗
我是那个装作忧愁的孩子

[chorus]
斑马斑马 安眠吧安眠吧
我会将你的青草带回故乡
斑马斑马 你还记得我吗

[chorus]
我只是一个匆忙的旅人啊
斑马斑马 安眠吧安眠吧
我要卖掉我的房子
漫游于天涯
